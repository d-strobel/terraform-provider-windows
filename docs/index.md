## Schema

### Required

- `endpoint` (String) Define the hostname or ip-address of the target Windows system. Can be set via 'WIN_ENDPOINT' environment variable.

### Optional

- `ssh` (Attributes) Define the SSH connection parameters. Exactly one of 'winrm' or 'ssh' must be set for the provider to connect to a Windows target system. Define an empty 'ssh' attribute if you wish to use the environment variables. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--ssh))
- `winrm` (Attributes) Define the WinRM connection parameters. Exactly one of 'winrm' or 'ssh' must be set for the provider to connect to a Windows target system. Define an empty 'winrm' attribute if you wish to use the environment variables. (see [below for nested schema](#nestedatt--winrm))
